# Java Learning Journey

This repository is a collection of mini projects, hands-on practice files, and core concept experiments written in Java. 
I'm currently learning Java and using this space to apply what I study, from basic syntax to object-oriented programming (OOP) and beyond.

I'm self-learning through various resources like the internet, YouTube tutorials, coding forums, and documentation. 
Exploring different Java topics, building small utilities, testing concepts, and improving step by step.

Whether it's through small projects or testing specific principles like inheritance, interfaces, and encapsulation, this serves as my personal practice ground to improve my skills as a developer
