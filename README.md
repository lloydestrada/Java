# Java Learning Journey

This repository is a collection of mini projects, practice exercises, and core concept tests written in Java. As someone currently studying and exploring the world of programming, this space serves as my personal lab for learning, practicing, and gradually being comfortable in Java â€” from basic syntax to object-oriented principles and in advance cores.

The goal of this repository is to document my progress, reinforce understanding through hands-on coding, and build a solid foundation in Java programming. Whether it's simple utilities, student record systems, or concept-focused test files, each part reflects my growth and ongoing journey toward becoming confident in Java development.
