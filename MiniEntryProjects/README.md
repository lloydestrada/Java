# Mini Java Projects

This repository contains a collection of mini Java console projects created for learning and practice purposes.

Each `.java` file is a small, entry-level program that helps build a foundation in Java programming. These projects are part of a personal journey to improve coding skills and continue learning Java step by step.

Projects include:
- Simple games
- Basic logic checkers
- Small utilities (like a calculator or banking system)
- A basic student record management system with object-oriented concepts
- etc.

This is a beginner-friendly project folder for experimenting and getting more comfortable with Java.
