# Student Record Management System

A beginner-friendly **Java console application** for managing student records using Object-Oriented Programming.

---

##  Features

-  Add a new student
-  View a student's details
-  Update a student's details
-  Prevent duplicate roll numbers
-  List all students
-  Exit the program

---

## OOP Concepts Used

This project uses **encapsulation** through:

- **Private fields** in the `Student` class
- **Public getters and setters**:
- `getName()`, `setName(String name)`
- `getRollNumber()`, `setRollNumber(int rollNumber)`
- `getDepartment()`, `setDepartment(String department)`
- `getGpa()`, `setGpa(double gpa)`

These methods allow controlled access and modification of the student data, keeping the class secure and modular.

## How It Works

- Input is handled using Java's `Scanner`
- Students are stored in an `ArrayList<Student>`
- A menu-driven loop enables interaction
- Duplicate roll numbers are blocked at the point of addition

---

## Requirements

- Java 8 or higher
- A terminal or IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse
